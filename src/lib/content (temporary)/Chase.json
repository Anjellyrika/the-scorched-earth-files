	"shortIntro": "Charles Winston Wright, aka Chase by his fans, is a 28 year-old half-elf, born to Horgan and Melissa Wright. A man of many talents: singing, songwriting, performing, and modeling, and has consistently topped Anstieg's “100 Best Celebrities” for three consecutive years. His rise to fame started in high school, with most of the songs he wrote inspired by his love for Victoria, even long after their rough breakup. Despite his grandiose life as a superstar, many misfortunes fell upon him, forcing him into vigilantism to rid his home Kostyn of injustice. He lives a double life and has adopted the moniker \"Shadow Stalker\".",
